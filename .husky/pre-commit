# This hook is invoked by git-commit, and can be bypassed with the
# --no-verify option. It takes no parameters, and is invoked before
# obtaining the proposed commit log message and making a commit.
# Exiting with a non-zero status from this script causes the git
# commit command to abort before creating a commit.

# The default pre-commit hook, when enabled, catches introduction of
# lines with trailing whitespaces and aborts the commit when such a
# line is found.

# All the git commit hooks are invoked with the environment variable
# GIT_EDITOR=: if the command will not bring up an editor to modify
# the commit message.

# The default pre-commit hook, when enabled and with the hooks.allownonascii
# config option unset or set to false prevents the use of non-ASCII filenames.

# We currently use this hook to update the changelog of the project
# and make sure all files are prettified before sending them to the commit.
# Generated files are added to the commit.
