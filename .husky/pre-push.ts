/**
 * This hook is called by git-push and can be used to prevent a
 * push from taking place. The hook is called with two parameters
 * which provide the name and location of the destination remote,
 * if a named remote is not being used both values will be the same.
 *
 * Information about what is to be pushed is provided on the hook's
 * standard input with lines of the form:
 * <local ref> SP <local object name> SP <remote ref> SP <remote object name> LF
 *
 * For instance, if the command git push origin master:foreign were
 * run the hook would receive a line like the following:
 * refs/heads/master 67890 refs/heads/foreign 12345
 *
 * although the full object name would be supplied. If the foreign ref
 * does not yet exist the <remote object name> will be the all-zeroes
 * object name. If a ref is to be deleted, the <local ref> will be
 * supplied as (delete) and the <local object name> will be the
 * all-zeroes object name. If the local commit was specified by
 * something other than a name which could be expanded
 * (such as HEAD~, or an object name) it will be supplied as it was
 * originally given.
 *
 * If this hook exits with a non-zero status, git push will abort without
 * pushing anything. Information about why the push is rejected may be
 * sent to the user by writing to standard error.
 *
 * We currently use this hook to verify that any commit (to any branch)
 * passes the tests configured.
 * If a tag is being pushed, then, we generate the documentation
 * and publish the generated folder to the corresponding docs branch
 * on the origin remote.
 * This particular project also updated the version of the library
 * to match that of the tag.
